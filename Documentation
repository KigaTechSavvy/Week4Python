How This Program Works:
File Read & Write:
⦁	Reads a file specified by the user
⦁	Modifies the content (in this case, converts it to uppercase)
⦁	Writes the modified content to a new file with "modified_" prefix

Error Handling Lab:
⦁	Handles several specific exceptions:
⦁	FileNotFoundError: When the file doesn't exist
⦁	PermissionError: When the user doesn't have read permissions
⦁	IsADirectoryError: When the path is a directory, not a file
⦁	UnicodeDecodeError: When trying to read a binary file as text
⦁	General Exception as a catch-all for other errors
